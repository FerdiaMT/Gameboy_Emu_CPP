# SM83 Game Boy Emulator

A **C++ Game Boy emulator** built from scratch, accurately replicating the SM83 CPU, PPU, and memory systems of Nintendoâ€™s original hardware.
Uses SDL3 for rendering the graphics.




## Features

- Full **SM83 CPU** instruction set (passes all Blaarg tests)
- **PPU** with scanline-based FIFO rendering (background, window, sprites in progress)
- **Accurate LCDC/STAT/LYC**, OAM search, and timing behavior
- **Boot ROM** supported (starts at 0x0000, no skip)
- Modular architecture: `CPU`, `PPU`, `Memory`, `Clock`
